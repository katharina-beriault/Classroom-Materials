    "## Intro to BI\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Intelligence is an application of data analysis that aids companies in making data-driven decisions. Using Business Intelligence technologies, we can provide insights into the performance of a business in the past and the present as well as make predictions or recommendations for the future. A key difference between Business Intelligence and data analysis is those insights are meant to be actionable and geared towards helping a business make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Business Intelligence tools are designed to make sense of the huge quantities of data that organizations accumulate over time. The BI tools analyze this information and present it as actionable information that can guide decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Business Intelligence software makes up a large heterogeneous category of software. Not all tools in the category can be meaningfully compared to each other. There are several types of BI tools of which the most substantive are the Full-Stack Business Intelligence Tools and Data Visualization Tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Job Market Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Analyst and Business Inteligence positions usually differ:\n",
    "* DA: more technical skills (might require python or R, deeper knowledge in statistics).\n",
    "* BI: more business related skills (usually uses drag and drop tools, excel, will hardly require ML).\n",
    "\n",
    "### KPIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Performance Indicators are metrics used by companies to give information on how well the business is doing. It is a crucial part of an analyst's job to use the most appropriate metrics to measure if the company is reaching certain objectives."

    "### Tableau\n",
    "\n",
    "Tableau is one of the most popular and intuitive applications for business intelligence and visual data exploration today. The application makes it easy to connect to an existing data source, create interactive visualizations, and perform basic analysis to discover insights. In this lesson, we will learn about the different features of Tableau and how it can be a valuable addition to your analytics tool kit. We will also cover how to load data into Tableau - both from file and hosted data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tableau has several features that make it a great tool for data analysis. In this section, we will highlight some of the most important ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Drag & Drop Interface`: One of the things that makes Tableau so popular is its ease of use. It allows you to intuitively drag and drop fields where you want them and move things around to get exactly the visualization you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Variety of Visualizations`: Tableau has several types of visualizations you can use - from bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots to area charts, bubble charts, treemaps. Speaking of maps, it also allows you to visualize your data geographically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Dashboards and Stories`: You can combine several visualizations into dashboards and stories that focus on communicating interesting insights with the stakeholders that need the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Data Exploration`: Perhaps one of Tableau's most useful features is how easy it is to explore data with it. You can start with an aggregated view of the data, filter to zoom in on something that looks interesting, add dimensions to get more well-rounded perspectives, and look at the underlying records to get to the bottom of what you are trying to investigate.\n",
