## Introduction

As a programmer, we must always pracatice our minds, our logic and our control of python syntax. On this lab, we will explore all of this with a few challenges in which we try to solve some problem with the most basic of python tools.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file. Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary. By the end of this lab, you will have leveled up your coding game.
