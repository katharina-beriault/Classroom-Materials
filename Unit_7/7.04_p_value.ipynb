    "Boys of a certain age are known to have a mean weight of 85 pounds. A complaint is made that the boys living in a municipal children's home are underfed. As one bit of evidence, 25 boys (of the same age) are weighed and found to have a mean weight of 80.94 pounds. It is known that the population standard deviation is 11.6 pounds. Based on the available data, what should be concluded concerning the complaint? \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "How to reason about the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that the population mean weight is 85, but we do not have the complete data from the population. Otherwise we would have calculated the actual mean directly. However we only have sample data from 25 subjects. So based on this sample data we will try to prove or disprove our assumption, using statistical test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Define the null hypothesis - This is our assumption about the population. It is defined by H0 and in this case H0: μ = 85;\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Define the alternative hypothesis - This means, what if our assumption is not true. It is defined by Ha and in this case Ha: μ < 85. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Determine if it is a one-tailed or a two-tailed test. Two-tailed is when the mean tested (alternative hypothesis) can be > or < then the mean of the population. In this case we are checking if the mean of the weight of the boys in the home is smaller then the mean of the population of boys, so it's a one-tailed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** Decide a test statistics based on the information available. Assuming data is normally distributed and number of observations are less and population variance is known (since population standard deviation is provided), we will use a z-test. This test is based on a \"z-distribution\" which is a normal distribution. If the population variance was not known or the testing sample is less then 30, we use a t-test. T test is based on students t distribution which is very similar to a standard normal distribution except that it is much flatter.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5:** Level of significance: This defines the rejection region/critical region, it's the probability of making the wrong decision when the null hypothesis is true. Usually it is 0.05. It is defined by greek letter 'alpha'. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6:** Calculate the test statistic based on the given information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 7:** Check the table.\n",
    "<br> For z-test you have fixed values according to Confidence Level.\n",
    "<br> For t-test you have to calculate according to the degrees of freedom (df), which is the *sample_size - 1*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 8:** Make conclusions:\n",
    "* If the test statistic falls in the critical region, then we reject the Null Hypothesis\n",
    "* If the test statistic falls in the region between the critical region, then we fail to reject the Null Hypothesis."
